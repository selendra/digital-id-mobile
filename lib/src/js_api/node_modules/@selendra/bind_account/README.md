## Why need Account Binding
- As dual blockchain which support both EVM transactions as well as Substrate like transactions.
- Account binding happens on **Selendra EVM**, you can bind your **SEL address** to a **SEL EVM address**. Once you bind the accounts,  you can use one account to interact with both EVM-based dApps as well as Substrate-based dApps.
